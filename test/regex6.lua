-- We don't follow Python behavior. We follow GAWK's.

-- From GAWK's rationale[1]:
--

--
-- Unlike Python, there's patsplit() if you need to possibly match empty
-- separators. Again, from GAWK's rationale[1]:
--
-- > On the other hand, regular expression matching with FPAT can match the null
-- > string, and the non-matching intervening characters function as the
-- > separators.
