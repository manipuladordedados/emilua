== Synopsis

[source,lua]
----
local fs = require "filesystem"
fs.create_directory(p: fs.path[, existing_p: fs.path]) -> boolean
fs.create_directories(p: fs.path) -> boolean
----

== Description

Creates the directory `p` as if by POSIX `mkdir()` with a second argument of
`0777`. If the function fails because `p` resolves to an existing directory, no
error is reported.

If `existing_p` is given, then the attributes of the new directory are copied
from `existing_p`.

`filesystem.create_directories()` calls `filesystem.create_directory()` for
every element of `p` that does not already exist.

Returns whether a directory was created for the directory `p` resolves to.
