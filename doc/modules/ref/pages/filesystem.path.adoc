Emilua - Lua execution engine

== Description

endif::[]

Objects of this class abstract path-manipulation algorithms for the host
operating system.

Methods from this class are purely computational and never trigger any
syscall. They only operate on the in-memory representation of a path. They do
not perform any operation on the filesytem. They do not initiate any I/O
request.

Paths are immutable. Any operation on a path will return a new path with the
result.

== Functions

=== `new() -> path`

[source,lua]
----
new()    -- <1>
new(str) -- <2>
----
<1> Default constructor.
<2> Create a path from an UTF-8 encoded string (in the host system format).

=== `from_generic(source: string) -> path`

Creates a path from the generic non-native format.

=== `to_generic(self) -> string`

Returns the path in the generic format encoded in UTF-8.

=== `iterator(self) -> function`

Returns an iterator to the path components. The iteration order follows:

1. The root name, if any.
2. The root directory, if any.
3. The sequence of file names, omitting directory separators.
4. If there is a directory separator after the last file name in the path, the
   last element is an empty element.

=== `make_preferred(self) -> path`

Returns a new path where all directory separators are converted to the preferred
directory separator.

TIP: On Windows, where `"\"` is the preferred separator, the path `"foo/bar"`
will be converted to `"foo\bar"`.

=== `remove_filename(self) -> path`

Returns a new path where the filename component is removed.

=== `replace_filename(self, replacement: string|path) -> path`

Returns a new path where the filename component is replaced.

=== `replace_extension(self[, replacement: string|path]) -> path`

Returns a new path where the extension is replaced (or removed on `nil`).

=== `lexically_normal(self) -> path`

Returns a new path converted to normal form.

=== `lexically_relative(self, base: string|path) -> path`

Returns a new path where `self` is made relative to `base`.

=== `lexically_proximate(self, base: string|path) -> path`

Same as above if the return is non empty. Same as `self`, otherwise.

== Properties

=== `root_name: string`

Returns the root name, or an empty path.

=== `root_directory: string`

Returns the root directory, or an empty path.

=== `root_path: path`

Returns `path.new(root_name) / root_directory`.

=== `relative_path: path`

Returns path relative to `root_path`.

=== `parent_path: path`

Returns the path to the parent directory.

=== `filename: string`

Returns filename component.

=== `stem: string`

Returns filename component stripped of its extension.

=== `extension: string`

Returns the extension of the filename component.

=== `empty: boolean`

Whether the path is empty.

=== `has_root_path: boolean`

Whether the root path is non-empty.

=== `has_root_name: boolean`

Whether the root name is non-empty.

=== `has_root_directory: boolean`

Whether the root directory is non-empty.

=== `has_relative_path: boolean`

Whether relative path is non-empty.

=== `has_parent_path: boolean`

Whether the parent path is non-empty.

=== `has_filename: boolean`

Whether the filename is non-empty.

=== `has_stem: boolean`

Whether the stem is non-empty.

=== `has_extension: boolean`

Whether the extension is non-empty.

=== `is_absolute: boolean`

Whether the path is absolute.

=== `is_relative: boolean`

Whether the path is relative.

== Metamethods

* `__tostring()`: Encodes the native representation as UTF-8 and returns it.
* `__eq()`: Compares two paths lexicographically.
* `__lt()`: Compares two paths lexicographically.
* `__le()`: Compares two paths lexicographically.
* `__div()`: Concatenates two paths with a directory separator.
* `__concat()`: Concatenates the underlying native representation of the paths
  (i.e. no additional directory separators are introduced). This operation may
  not be portable between operating systems.

== Module attributes

=== `preferred_separator: string`

The preferred directory separator on the host operating system encoded in UTF-8.
