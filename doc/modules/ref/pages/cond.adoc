A condition variable.

== Functions

=== `new() -> cond`

Constructor.

=== `wait(self, m: mutex)`

Read `pthread_cond_wait()`

`wait()` is an interruption point. Prior to the delivery of the interruption
request, the underlying mutex is re-acquired under the hood.

=== `notify_all(self)`

Read `pthread_cond_broadcast()`.

=== `notify_one(self)`

Read `pthread_cond_signal()`.

== Notifying without a lock

If the condition variable, the notifier fiber and the waiting fiber all run in
the same thread (and cooperative multitasking is used instead preemptive
multitasking), then there is enough level of determinism to lift one restriction
that exists in traditional condition variables.

Even if the shared variable is atomic, it must be modified under the mutex in
order to correctly publish the modification to the waiting thread.

The reason why this restriction on the notifier fiber/thread exists is to avoid
a race. Consider the following waiter fiber and the notifier fiber:

[source,lua]
----
local function consumer()
    scope(function()
        scope_cleanup_push(function() m:unlock() end)
        m:lock()
        while not ready do
            c:wait(m)
        end

        -- ...
    end)
end

local function producer()
    ready = true
    c:notify_one()
end
----

Pay attention to the points when the waiter fiber checks if the event has been
signalled by testing `ready` and the instant it blocks on `c.wait()`. If the
notifier fiber mutates the shared variable and calls `c.notify_one()` between
these two points, then the signalization is lost. `c.notify_one()` would be
called by the time there would be no fiber blocked on `c.wait()`. Thatâ€™s why the
notifier fiber need to mutate the shared variable through a mutex.

In Emilua, this restriction doesn't apply (as long as there are no suspension
points between the time the waiting fiber tests the condition and calls
`c.wait()`) and the notifier fiber can mutate the shared variable without
holding a lock on the mutex. In this case, the condition variable essentially
becomes a non-suspending way (post semantics) to unpark a parked fiber (yes,
I've exploited this property in the past to avoid a few round-trips).
