____
This operation is implemented in terms of zero or more calls to the stream's
async_read_some function, and is known as a _composed operation_. The program
must ensure that the stream performs no other read operations (such as
async_read, the stream's async_read_some function, or any other composed
operations that perform reads) until this operation completes.
