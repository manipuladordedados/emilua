== Name

Emilua - Lua execution engine

== Description

endif::[]

WARNING: The `http` module is experimental.

Represents an HTTP response. This extra level of indirection — as opposed to as,
for instance, making it part of `http.socket` — makes it easier to map semantics
such as HTTP pipelining w/o imposing even more confusing state machines.

== Functions

=== `new() -> http.response`

Constructor.

== Attributes

=== `status: number`

The HTTP status code.

=== `reason: string`

The HTTP reason phrase.

=== `headers: http.headers`

The HTTP headers.

.See also:

* xref:http.headers.adoc[http.headers(3em)].

=== `body: string`

The HTTP body.

That's a clunky abstraction actually. It'll be replaced in a future release for
a proper byte span abstraction (e.g. Go's slices).

=== `trailers: http.headers`

The HTTP trailers.

.See also:

* xref:http.headers.adoc[http.headers(3em)].
