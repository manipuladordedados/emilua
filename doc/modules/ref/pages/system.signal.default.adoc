[source,lua]
----
local system = require "system"
system.signal.default(signal: integer)
----

== Description

Reset ``signal``'s handling to the system's default.

NOTE: There's no need to set the default handlers at the start of the
program. The Emilua runtime will already do that for you.

NOTE: This function will fail if you try to reset a signal for which a
`system.signal.set` object exists.

NOTE: Only the master VM is allowed to use this function.

NOTE: This function is only available to POSIX systems.
