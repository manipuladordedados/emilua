Exit the VM. Other VMs in the process are not stopped.

== Parameters

=== `code`

If caller is the main VM, `code` is used as the application exit code.

=== `opts`

If caller is the main VM, then `opts` is a table that accepts the following
options:

`force=0`:: Nothing. That's the default behaviour.
`force=1`:: Not implemented yet.
`force=2`:: Exit the process forcefully (little to none cleanup steps are
performed).
`force="abort"`:: Exit the process even more forcefully (equivalent to the C
function `abort()`).
