A mutex.

== Functions

=== `new() -> mutex`

Constructor.

=== `lock(self)`

Locks the mutex.

NOTE: This suspending function does *not* act as an interruption point.

NOTE: This mutex applies dispatch semantics. That means no context switch to
other ready fibers will take place if it's possible to acquire the mutex
immediately.

=== `try_lock(self) -> boolean`

Tries to lock the mutex. Returns whether lock acquisition was successful.

CAUTION: It's an error to call `try_lock()` if current fiber already owns the
mutex (cf. recursive_mutex(3em) for an alternative).

NOTE: The current fiber is never suspended.

=== `unlock(self)`

Unlocks the mutex.
