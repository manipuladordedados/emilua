== Description

endif::[]

A recursive mutex.

A fiber that already has exclusive ownership of a given `recursive_mutex`
instance can call `lock()` or `try_lock()` to acquire an additional level of
ownership of the mutex. `unlock()` must be called once for each level of
ownership acquired by a single fiber before ownership can be acquired by another
fiber.

== Functions

=== `new() -> recursive_mutex`

Constructor.

=== `lock(self)`

Locks the mutex.

NOTE: This suspending function does *not* act as an interruption point.

NOTE: This mutex applies dispatch semantics. That means no context switch to
other ready fibers will take place if it's possible to acquire the mutex
immediately.

=== `try_lock(self) -> boolean`

Tries to lock the mutex. Returns whether lock acquisition was successful.

NOTE: The current fiber is never suspended.

=== `unlock(self)`

Unlocks the mutex.
