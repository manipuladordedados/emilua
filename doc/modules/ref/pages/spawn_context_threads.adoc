Emilua - Lua execution engine

== Synopsis

[source,lua]
----
spawn_context_threads(count: integer)
----

== Description

Spawns extra `count` threads to the thread pool of the caller VM.

TIP: Emilua can handle multiple VMs running on the same thread just
fine. Cooperative multitasking is used to alternate execution among the
ready VMs.

[NOTE]
====
It doesn't make sense to have more context threads than actors as some threads
will always be idle in this scenario.

No safety-belts will prevent you from running such inefficient layout.
