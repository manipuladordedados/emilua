== Synopsis

[source,lua]
----
local fs = require "filesystem"
fs.last_write_time(p: fs.path) -> fs.clock.time_point -- <1>
fs.last_write_time(p: fs.path, tp: fs.clock.time_point) -- <2>
----
<1> Get last write time.
<2> Set last write time.

== Description

Get or set the time of the last modification of `p`.

NOTE: Symlinks are followed.

NOTE: It is not guaranteed that immediately after setting the write time, the
value returned by (1) is the same as what was passed as the argument to (2)
because the file system's time may be more granular than
`filesystem.clock.time_point`.
