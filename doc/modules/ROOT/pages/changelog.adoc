:_:
:cpp: C++

== 0.6

* Convert decomposition functions from filesystem.path to properties:
  `root_name`, `root_directory`, `root_path`, `relative_path`, `parent_path`,
  `filename`, `stem`, `extension`.
* Convert some filesystem.path properties to string: `root_name`,
  `root_directory`, `filename`, `stem`, `extension`.
* filesystem.path.iterator() will return strings at each iteration now.
* Add more functions to the module filesystem: `exists()`, `is_block_file()`,
  `is_character_file()`, `is_directory()`, `is_fifo()`, `is_other()`,
  `is_regular_file()`, `is_socket()`, `is_symlink()`, `mode()`. It was already
  possible to query for these attributes. These functions were added as an extra
  convenience.
* Add yet more functions to the module filesystem: `mkfifo()`, `mknod()`,
  `makedev()`.
* New socket options to retrieve security labels from UNIX sockets endpoints.
* Remove HTTP & WebSocket classes. They should be offered as separate plugins.

== 0.5

* Add `mutex.try_lock()`.
* Add module `recursive_mutex`.
* Add module `future`.
* Add `filesystem.chown()`.
* Enable IPC-based actors on all UNIX systems.
* spawn_vm() performs the same module path resolution from require() now. That
  means it's possible to use root-imports from spawn_vm().
* spawn_vm() parameters refactored (API break).
* Add Linux Landlock support.
* Add FreeBSD Capsicum support.

== 0.4

* A new `byte_span` type akin to Go slices is used for IO ops.
* Actor channels now can transceive file descriptors.
* Support for Linux namespaces. Now you can set up sandboxes and run isolated
  actors (or just the well-known containers).
* Upgrade to {cpp}20. The motivating feature for the upgrade was
  `std::atomic<std::weak_ptr<T>>`. However, other {cpp}20 features are being
  used as well.
* Removed `println()`.
* Removed `sleep_for`. Its functionality has been replaced by the module `time`.
* Moved `steady_timer` to the new module `time`.
* Removed `ip.tcp.resolver`. Its functionality has been replaced by
  `ip.get_address_info()`.
* `tls.ctx` renamed to `tls.context`.
* Modules `ip` and `tls` grew a lot. The API for sockets now supports IO ops on
  `byte_span` instances, and plenty of new functions and classes (including UDP)
  were added.
* `inbox.recv()` renamed to `inbox.receive()`
* Module `cond` renamed to `condition_variable`.
* `error_code.cat` renamed to `error_code.category`.
* `spawn_ctx_threads()` renamed to `spawn_context_threads()`.
* `inherit_ctx` renamed to `inherit_context` in `spawn_vm()`.
* New modules.
** `time`: clocks and timers.
** `pipe`.
** `unix`: UNIX domain sockets.
** `serial_port`: serial ports.
** `system`: UNIX signals, CLI args, env vars, process credentials, and much
   more.
** `file`: file IO. Only available on systems with proactors (e.g. Windows with
   IOCP, and Linux with io_uring). BSD can still be supported later (with kqueue
   + POSIX AIO).
** `filesystem`: portable path-manipulation, and plenty of filesystem operations
   & algorithms.
** `stream`: AWK-inspired scanner and common stream algorithms.
** `regex`: Basic regex functions. The interface has been inspired by {cpp},
   Python and AWK.
** `generic_error`: portable error comparison for filesystem, sockets, and much
   more.
** `asio_error`: errors thrown by the asio layer.
** `websocket`.
* Lua programs can define their own error categories now.
* Several new OS-specific APIs (e.g. Linux capabilities, and Windows'
  `TransmitFile()`).
* Add `http.request.upgrade_desired()`.
* `http.socket` can work on top of UNIX domain stream sockets now.
* Now Emilua is less liberal on accepted values for env var `EMILUA_COLORS`.
* Finer-grained cancellation of IO ops.
* Locales are set at application startup.
* Bug fixes.
* The build system now makes use of Meson's wrap system.
* Documentation can now be installed as manpages.
* Support for io_uring.

== 0.3

* HTTP request and response objects now use read-write locks and there is some
  limited sharing that you can do with them without stumbling upon EBUSY errors.
* Improvements to the module system (that's the main feature for this
  release). You should be able to use guix as the package manager for your
  emilua projects.
* EMILUA_PATH environment variable.
* Native plugins API (it can be disabled at build configure time).
* Add logging module.
* Add manpage.
* `--version` CLI arg.
* Build configure options to disable threading.
* Use fmtlib from host system.

== 0.2

* Fix build when compiler is GCC.
* Refactor module system. The new module system is incompatible with the
  previous one. Please refer to the documentation.
* Add HTTP query function: `http.request.continue_required()`.
* Remove `failed_to_load_module` error code. Now you should see `"iostream
  error"` or other more informative error reasons upon a failed module load.
* Numeric values for error codes changed.
