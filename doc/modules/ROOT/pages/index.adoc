Emilua is an execution engine. As a runtime for your Lua programs, it'll
orchestrate concurrent systems by providing proper primitives you can build
upon.

Emilua is not a framework. You don't design the structure of your software by
extending a complex concurrency framework. On the contrary, you start *simple*
and only makes use of primitives your application needs. Should you only have
the need for simple serial programs, you'll have access to plenty of IO
abstractions that work across a broad range of platforms.

== Fibers

....

When your software grows and the need to increase the concurrency level a notch
arises, just spawn fibers. The same IO abstractions that work on serial programs
will work on concurrent programs as well. You don't need to pay an extra huge
cost by completely refactoring your program during this
transition{_}footnote:[Emilua doesn't suffer from

Nystrom' two colors problem].].

Emilua has first-class support for modern sandboxing technologies.

* Linux namespaces.
* Linux's Landlock.
* FreeBSD's Capsicum.

Mitigate risks by creating disposable cheap sandboxes to parse untrusted input
data.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capability-based_security[Sandboxing support on
Emilua is based around capabilities] and elegantly integrates with the same
machinery that is used to implement the actor model.

Compartmentalised application development is, of necessity, distributed
application development, with software components running in different processes
and communicating via message passing.
____

The only resource a sandbox starts with is `inbox` and its only method:
`receive()`. In this initial state, a sandbox _can't even ask_ for new resources
(i.e. it's a push model). The Lua VM on the host system can then selectively
choose which resources are safe to hand over (e.g. read-only access to a file
and a pipe).

== Cross-platform

* Windows.
* Linux.
* FreeBSD.

Emilua is powered by the battle-tested and scar-accumulating Boost.Asio library
to drive IO and itâ€™ll make use of
https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_81_0/doc/html/boost_asio/overview/implementation.html[native
APIs in a long list of supported platforms]. However processor ISA
compatibility will be http://luajit.org/install.html[limited by LuaJIT
availability].

== Network IO

* TCP.
* UDP.
* TLS.
* Address/service forward/reverse name resolution.
* IPv6 support (and mostly transparent).
* Cancellable operations transparently integrated into the fiber interruption
  API.
* Several generic algorithms.
* Experimental HTTP and WebSocket support. In later releases they should be
  split into their own plugin so they can evolve and follow their own release
  schedules without impacting core Emilua.

== IPC

* UNIX domain sockets (stream, datagram, and seqpacket).
* `SCM_RIGHTS` fd-passing.
* Pipes.
* UNIX signals.
* Ctty job control (and basic pty support).

== Filesystem API

* It easily abstracts path manipulation for different platforms (e.g. POSIX &
  Windows).
* Transparently translates to UTF-8 while retaining the native representation
  for the underlying system under the hood.
* Directory iterators (flat and recursive).
* APIs to query attributes, manipulate permissions, and the like.
* Lots of algorithms (e.g. symlink-resolving path canonization, subtrees
  copying, etc).
* It focuses on cross-platform support, so not all operations are supported yet,
  but some platform-specific extensions are already available (e.g. non-Windows
  umask(3p)).

== Misc features

* Complete fiber API (sync primitives, interruption API, clean-up handlers,
  fiber local storage, assert-like scheduling constraints, ...).
* Integrates with Lua builtins (i.e. you can mix up fibers and coroutines,
  modules, ...).
* AWK-inspired scanner to parse textual streams easily.
* Clocks & timers.
* File IO (for proactors only{_}footnote:[Right now, Windows' IOCP, and Linux's
  io_uring.], so the main thread never blocks).
* Serial ports.
* A basic regex module.
* Native JSON module.
* Portable error code comparison.
* And much more.
