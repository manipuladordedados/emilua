Do notice that the table won't go into many details. For instance, several
projects allow you to use threads, but only Emilua is flexible enough that it
actually allows you to create heterogeneous thread pools where some thread may
be pinned to a single Lua VM while another thread is shared among several Lua
VMs, and some work-stealing thread pool takes care of the rest. Too many tables
would be needed to explore all the other differences.

Integrated IO engine also belongs to the comparison of concurrency models, but a
separate table solely focused on them will be presented later (only mentioning
the projects that do have one).

.NodeJS wannabes

When you create a project that tries to bring together the best of two worlds,
you're also actually bringing together the worst of two worlds. This sums up
most of the attempts to mirror NodeJS API:

* If everything is implemented correctly, it can only achieve being as bad as
  NodeJS is.
* Horrible back-pressure.

This document deliberately left some projects out of the comparison tables. The
underlying reason is that it focuses on one problem space: the traditional
userspace-in-a-modern-OS-box. Projects such as
eLua{\_}footnote:[<https://eluaproject.net/>],
NodeMCU{_}footnote:[<https://nodemcu.readthedocs.io/>],
XDPLua{\_}footnote:[<https://victornogueirario.github.io/xdplua/>], and
Snabb{_}footnote:[<https://github.com/snabbco/snabb>] will always have a space
in the market. And the reason is quite simple: it's not possible to cater for
very specific needs and be general at the same time. For instance, if you're
trying to run something on the kernel side, there are specific restrictions and
concerns that will further contaminate every dependant project down the
line. It's not merely a question of porting the same API over. The mindset
behind the whole program would need to change as well.

Emilua is young and there are plans to explore part of use cases that stretch
just a little over the traditional userspace-in-a-modern-OS-box. However it
still is a general cross-platform solution for an execution engine. It's still
not possible to tackle very specific use cases and be general at the same time.

== https://openresty.org/[OpenResty]

Most of the languages are not designed to make the programmer worry about memory
allocation failing. Lua is no different. If you want to deal with resource
exhaustion, C and {cpp} are the only good choices.

A web server written in lua exposed directly to the web is rarely a good idea as
it can't properly handle allocation failures or do proper resource management in
a few other areas.

OpenResty's core is a C application (nginx). The lua application that can be
written on top is hosted by this C runtime that is well aware of the
connections, the process resources and its relationships to each lua-written
handler. The runtime then can perform proper resource management. Lua is a mere
slave of this runtime, it doesn't really own anything.

This architecture works quite well while gives productivity to the web
application developer. Emilua can't just compete with OpenResty. Go for
OpenResty if you're doing an app exposed to the wide web.

Emilua can perform better for client apps that you deliver to customers. For
instance, you might develop a torrent client with Emilua and it would work
better than OpenResty. Emilua HTTP interface is also designed more like a
gateway interface, so we can, in the future, implement this interface as an
OpenResty lib to easily allow porting apps over.

* Emilua can also be used behind a proper server.
* Emilua can be used to quickly prototype the architecture of apps to be written
  later in {cpp} using an API that resembles Boost.Asio a lot (and
  https://github.com/blinktrade/iofiber[IOFiber] will bring them even closer).
* In the future, Emilua will be able to make use of native plug-ins so you can
  offload much of the resource management.
* Emilua apps can do some level of resource (under)management by restricting the
  number of connections/fibers/...
* Emilua won't be that bad given its defaults (active async style, no implicit
  write buffer to deal with concurrent writes, many abstractions designed with
  back-pressure in mind, ...).
* The actor model opens up some possibilities for Emilua's future
  (e.g. partition your app resources among multiple VMs and feel free to kill
  the bad VMs).
