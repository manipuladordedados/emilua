Emilua - Lua execution engine

== Description

endif::[]

Emilua is a concurrency runtime for Lua programs. The intra-VM concurrency
support is exploited to offer async I/O. IO errors reported from the operating
system are preserved and reported back to the user. That's specially important
for logging and tracing.

POSIX systems report errors through `errno`. Meanwhile Windows report errors
through `GetLastError()`. In both cases, we have an integer holding an error
code. So that's the first piece of information captured and reported.

The enumeration for `errno` cannot be extended by libraries or user code, so
each new module that uses the same error reporting style (integer error codes)
must defined their own enumeration (which can safely conflict with error code
values from `errno`). The origin of the integer code defines the error
domain. For instance, POSIX's `getaddrinfo()` uses its own set of error codes
(``EAI_``...). The error domain is the second piece of information captured and
reported by Emilua: that's the error category.

An error reported by Emilua is a Lua table with two members:

`code: integer`:: The error code (e.g. value from `errno`).

`category: userdata`:: An object that encodes the error domain (e.g. whether
value was read out of `errno`).

Extra information about the error's origin might be available depending on the
function that throws the error (e.g. many functions attach the integer `"arg"`
for `EINVAL` errors).

== The error category

Error categories define the metamethods ``++__++tostring()`` and
``++__++eq()``. The category for errors read from `errno` (or `GetLastError()`
on Windows) will return `"system"` for ``++__++tostring()``. That's the
category's name.

Another important category on Emilua is the `"generic"` category. This category
is meant to represent POSIX errors (even on Windows). The purpose of this
category is to compare errors portably so you can write cross-platform programs,
but you'll see more on that later.

=== `message(self, code: integer) -> string`

Returns the explanatory message string for the error specified by `code`.

For the `"system"` category on POSIX platforms, that's the same as strerror(3p).

== The error table

The metatable for raised error tables also define the metamethods
``++__++tostring()`` and ``++__++eq()``. Its ``++__++tostring()`` is just a
shorthand to use the category's `message()`. Only `code` and `category` are
compared for ``++__++eq()`` and extra members are ignored.

=== `togeneric(self) -> error_code`

That's a function present in ``++__++index``. It'll return the default error
condition for `self`.

For instance, `filesystem.create_hard_link()` will report the original error
from the OS so you don't lose information on errors. On Windows, this function
might throw `ERROR_ALREADY_EXISTS`, but this error maps perfectly to POSIX's
`EEXIST`. If you're _reacting_ on error codes to determine an action to take
(i.e. you're actually handling the error instead of throwing it up higher in the
stack or logging/tracing it), then adding the specific error code for each
platform serves you no purpose. That's the purpose for the function
`togeneric()`. If there's a mapping between the error code and POSIX, it'll
return a new error table from the `"generic"` category. If no such mapping
exists, the original error is returned.

local ok, ec = pcall(...)
if ec:togeneric() == generic_error.EEXIST then
    -- ...

== RDF error categories

Errors are also user-extensible by defining your own error categories. Emilua
has the concept of modules defined by RDF's Turtle
files{_}footnote:[<https://github.com/JoshData/rdfabout>]. In the future, this
will also be used to define application/packaging resources in Android and
Windows binaries, for instance. However, right now, they're only used to define
error categories.

[Turtle is] RDF syntax for those with taste

Just throw a `.ttl` file in the place where you'd put your `.lua` file and the
module system will find it.

[source,lua]
----
local my_error_category = require "/my_error_category"

-- it creates a new error every time,
-- so you don't need to worry about reusing
-- old values
local my_error = my_error_category.EGREGIOUS
my_error.context = "Lorem ipsum"
error(my_error)

[NOTE]
====

You can also refer to errors in a category module by number, but that should be
avoided:

[source,lua]
----
error(my_error_category[2])
----
====

You can also define a mapping for generic errors:

[source,turtle]
----
@prefix cat: <https://schema.emilua.org/error_category/0/#>.

<about:emilua-module>
	a <https://schema.emilua.org/error_category/0/>;
	cat:error [
		cat:code 1;
		cat:alias "operation_would_block",
			"resource_unavailable_try_again";
		cat:message "Resource temporarily unavailable";
		cat:generic_error "EAGAIN"
	].
----

[NOTE]
====
It might be useful to define generic errors for categories other than
`"generic"`
too{_}footnote:[<http://breese.github.io/2017/05/12/customizing-error-codes.html>]. However
Emilua doesn't offer this ability yet as someone needs to put some thought on
the design.
====

This is an unusual design in the Lua ecosystem, so you might want some
rationale:
