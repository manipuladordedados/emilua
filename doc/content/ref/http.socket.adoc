Emilua's HTTP socket is modelled with gateways in mind. That means it should be
easy to replace the embedded server model with alternative backends and
applications won't be forced to migrate to a different interface.

The interface doesn't presume a reverse proxy. Alternative backends implementing
the same interface can be developed with little penalty.

The socket is also modelled as a symmetric socket. The client/server distinction
only happens after the first action. A symmetric socket is useful to sockets
supporting rendezvous connections (e.g. custom uTP).

== Functions

=== `new(sock: ip.tcp.socket | tls.socket) -> http.socket`

Constructor.

=== `close(self)`

Close the socket.

NOTE: If the underlying socket is a protocol implemented in userspace (e.g. a
TLS socket), then this operation might suspend the fiber.

=== `read_some(self, message: http.request | http.response)`

Initiate an operation to read a part of the message body (or the trailers
section) and blocks current fiber until it completes or errs.

Output is written to `message` as the rules laid out in
<https://boostgsoc14.github.io/boost.http/#socket_concept>
(`async_read_some`).

=== `write(self, message: http.request | http.response)`

Initiate an operation to write a chunk of the HTTP body data payload (chunked
message) and blocks current fiber until it completes or errs.

Behaviour follows the rules laid out in
<https://boostgsoc14.github.io/boost.http/#socket_concept>
(`async_write`).

=== `write_trailers(self, message: http.request | http.response)`

Initiate an operation to write the trailer part of the message (chunked message)
and blocks current fiber until it completes or errs.

Behaviour follows the rules laid out in
<https://boostgsoc14.github.io/boost.http/#socket_concept>
(`async_write_trailers`).

=== `write_end_of_message(self)`

Initiate an operation to signalize the sent message is complete (chunked
message) and blocks current fiber until it completes or errs.

Behaviour follows the rules laid out in
<https://boostgsoc14.github.io/boost.http/#socket_concept>
(`async_write_end_of_message`).

=== `read_request(self, req: http.request)`

Initiate an operation to read a HTTP request and blocks current fiber until it
completes or errs.

Output is written to `req` as the rules laid out in
<https://boostgsoc14.github.io/boost.http/#server_socket_concept>
(`async_read_request`).

=== `write_response(self, res: http.response)`

Initiate an operation to write the HTTP response `res` and blocks current fiber
until it completes or errs.

Behaviour follows the rules laid out in
<https://boostgsoc14.github.io/boost.http/#server_socket_concept>
(`async_write_response`).

=== `write_response_continue(self)`

Initiate an operation to write a response with the semantics from a “100
(Continue) response” and blocks current fiber until it completes or errs.

Behaviour follows the rules laid out in
<https://boostgsoc14.github.io/boost.http/#server_socket_concept>
(`async_write_response_continue`).

=== `write_response_metadata(self, res: http.response)`

Initiate an operation to write the response metadata (chunked message) and
blocks current fiber until it completes or errs.

Behaviour follows the rules laid out in
<https://boostgsoc14.github.io/boost.http/#server_socket_concept>
(`async_write_response_metadata`).

=== `write_request(self, req: http.request)`

Initiate an operation to write the HTTP request `req` and blocks current fiber
until it completes or errs.

Behaviour follows the rules laid out in
<https://boostgsoc14.github.io/boost.http/#client_socket_concept>
(`async_write_request`).

=== `write_request_metadata(self, req: http.request)`

Initiate an operation to write the HTTP request metadata found in `req` and
blocks current fiber until it completes or errs.

Behaviour follows the rules laid out in
<https://boostgsoc14.github.io/boost.http/#client_socket_concept>
(`async_write_request_metadata`).

=== `read_response(self, res: http.response)`

Initiate an operation to read a HTTP response and blocks current fiber until it
completes or errs.

Output is written to `res` as the rules laid out in
<https://boostgsoc14.github.io/boost.http/#client_socket_concept>
(`async_read_response`).

=== `lock_client_to_http10(self)`

Lock HTTP to HTTP/1.0 version if socket is used as a client socket.

== Attributes

=== `is_open: boolean`

Whether the socket is open.

=== `read_state: string`

The current state in the HTTP incoming request or HTTP incoming response.

Be prepared to face multiple state changes after a single action is scheduled
(e.g. you issue read-message action and the state already changed to finished
when the operation returns).

==== Member constants (incoming request)

.Incoming request
image::/emilua/read_request_state.png[]

`"empty"`::
This is the initial state. It means that the request object wasn't read yet.

`"message_ready"`::
This state is reached from the `"empty"` state, once you ask for a new message.
+
No more `read_request()` actions can be issued from this state.
+
From this state, you can issue the `read_some()` action. The state will change
to `"body_ready"` once all body was read. In streaming connections
(e.g. HTTP/1.1 chunked entities), this condition (body fully received) might
never happen.
+
Once this state is reached, you can safely use the read start line and the
headers.

`"body_ready"`::
This state is reached from the `"message_ready"`, once the http producer (e.g.
embedded server) fully received the message body.
+
From this state, you can only issue the `read_some()` action.
+
Once this state is reached, you can safely assume that no more body parts will
be received.

`"finished"`::
It means the message is complete and you can no longer issue another
`read_request()` until something else is done (e.g. send another http
response). This is a different/special value, because the “something else to do”
might not be related to read actions.
+
It can be reached from `"body_ready"` state, after all trailers have been
received. It's safe to assume that all message data is available by the time
this state is reached.

==== Member constants (incoming response)

.Incoming response
image::/emilua/read_response_state.png[]

`"empty"`::
This is the initial state.
+
There are two ways to interpret this state. It might mean that the response
object wasn't read yet.
+
Another interpretation is that it was reached from the `"body_ready"` state
(directly — through a call to `read_some()` — or indirectly — through a call to
`read_response()`), after all trailers have been received. It's safe to assume
that all message data is available if this is the case.
+
At this state, you can only issue a `read_response()` action.

`"message_ready"`::
This state is reached from the `"empty"` state, once you ask for a new message.
+
No more `read_response()` actions can be issued from this state.
+
From this state, you can issue the `read_some()` action. The state will change
to `"body_ready"` once all body was read. In streaming connections
(e.g. HTTP/1.1 chunked entities), this condition (body fully received) might
never happen.
+
Once this state is reached, you can safely use the read start line and the
headers.

`"body_ready"`::
This state is reached from the `"message_ready"`, once the http producer
(e.g. an http client) fully received the message body.
+
From this state, you can only issue the `read_some()` action.
+
Once this state is reached, you can safely assume that no more body parts will
be received.

=== `write_state: string`

The current state in the HTTP outgoing response or HTTP outgoing request.

==== Member constants (outgoing response)

.Outgoing response
image::/emilua/write_response_state.png[]

`"empty"`::
This is the initial state.
+
It means that the response object hasn't been sent yet.
+
At this state, you can only issue the metadata or issue a continue action (if
continue is supported/used in this HTTP transaction). Even if continue was
requested it's optional to issue a continue action and only required if you need
the request's body.

`"continue_issued"`::
This state is reached from the `"empty"` state, once you issue a continue
action.
+
No more continue actions can be issued from this state.

`"metadata_issued"`::
This state can be reached either from `"empty"` or `"continue_issued"`.
+
It happens when the metadata (start line + header section) is issued (through
`write_response_metadata()`).
+
From this state, you can only issue the body, the trailers or the end of the
message.

`"finished"`::
The message is considered complete once this state is reached.
+
You can no longer issue anything once this state is reached. The underlying
channel will change the `write_state` to `"empty"` once some unspecified event
occurs. This event is usually a new request.

==== Member constants (outgoing request)

.Outgoing request
image::/emilua/write_request_state.png[]

`"empty"`::
This is the initial state.
+
It means that the request object hasn't been sent yet.
+
At this state, you can only issue the metadata.

`"metadata_issued"`::
This state can be reached from `"empty"`.
+
It happens when the metadata (start line + header section) is issued (through
`write_request_metadata()`).
+
From this state, you can only issue the body, the trailers or the end of the
message.

=== `is_write_response_native_stream: boolean`

Whether the current message exchange supports native stream (i.e. chunked
encoding). It only makes sense to query this property in server-mode
(i.e. before you write a response).

NOTE: It raises an error if called when `read_state ~= "empty"`.
