title = "http.request"
+++

Represents an HTTP request. This extra level of indirection — as opposed to as,
for instance, making it part of `http.socket` — makes it easier to map semantics
such as HTTP pipelining w/o imposing even more confusing state machines.

== Functions

=== `new() -> http.request`

Constructor.

== Attributes

=== `method: string`

The HTTP method/verb (e.g. `"GET"`, `"POST"`).

=== `target: string`

The HTTP request target (e.g. `"/index.html"`, `"http://example.com/"`).

=== `headers: http.headers`

The HTTP headers.

.See also:

* link:../http.headers[`http.headers`].

=== `body: string`

The HTTP body.

That's a clunky abstraction actually. It'll be replaced in a future release for
a proper byte span abstraction (e.g. Go's slices).

=== `trailers: http.headers`

The HTTP trailers.
