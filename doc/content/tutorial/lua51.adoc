Emilua is based on LuaJIT which means Lua 5.1 + some Lua 5.2 extensions. However
some builtin Lua modules conflict with Emilua modules and thus are not
available. This page lists the divergences.

== Enabled modules

* Basic library, which includes the coroutine sub-library.
* String.
* Table.
* Math.
* BitOp.
* JIT.
* FFI.

In other words, the following modules are *not* enabled:

* IO.
* OS.
* Package (a replacement which may or may not be a drop-in replacement will be
  available in the future).
* Debug (it'll be available in a future release).
