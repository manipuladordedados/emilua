= CHANGELOG

== 0.3

* Add rules for headers installation. The headers are necessary for native
  plug-ins.

== 0.2

* Fix build when compiler is GCC.
* Refactor module system. The new module system is incompatible with the
  previous one. Please refer to the documentation.
* Add HTTP query function: `http.request.continue_required()`.
* Remove `failed_to_load_module` error code. Now you should see `"iostream
  error"` or other more informative error reasons upon a failed module load.
* Numeric values for error codes changed.
