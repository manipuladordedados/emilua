= CHANGELOG

== 0.4

* Add `sys.args`.
* Add `sys.env`.

== 0.3

* HTTP request and response objects now use read-write locks and there is some
  limited sharing that you can do with them without stumbling upon EBUSY errors.
* Improvements to the module system (that's the main feature for this
  release). You should be able to use guix as the package manager for your
  emilua projects.
* EMILUA_PATH environment variable.
* Native plugins API (it can be disabled at build configure time).
* Add logging module.
* Add manpage.
* `--version` CLI arg.
* Build configure options to disable threading.
* Use fmtlib from host system.

== 0.2

* Fix build when compiler is GCC.
* Refactor module system. The new module system is incompatible with the
  previous one. Please refer to the documentation.
* Add HTTP query function: `http.request.continue_required()`.
* Remove `failed_to_load_module` error code. Now you should see `"iostream
  error"` or other more informative error reasons upon a failed module load.
* Numeric values for error codes changed.
