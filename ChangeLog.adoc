= CHANGELOG

== 0.2

* Fix build when compiler is GCC.
* Refactor module system. The new module system is incompatible with the
  previous one. Please refer to the documentation.
* Remove `failed_to_load_module` error code. Now you should see `"iostream
  error"` or other more informative error reasons upon a failed module load.
* Numeric values for error codes changed.
